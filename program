write a program to print the positive difference of any two numbers



if num1>num2;
  diff=num1-num2
else;
 diff num2-num1
 print("The difference of{} and {}is {}".format(Num1,num2,diff)
                  
                  
                  OR
                  
                 
   num1=float(input("1st Number;))
   num2=float(input(2nd Number;))
   diff=num1-num2
  if diff<o:
    diff=diff*-1
  print("The difference of {} and {} is{}".format(num1,num2,diff))
